Introduction
------------

This extension provides a Data Filter (see extension "tesseract" for a
general explanation) which is capable of retrieving data from many
sources and format them into a Data Filter Structure. This structure
can then be used by a Data Provider to filter the data it will return.

On top of strictly filtering the data, the Data Filter can also return
information about capping the results (corresponding to the
LIMIT/OFFSET keywords of SQL) and about sorting the data.
